In this project, a linear classification model is used to identify digits in pairs, i.e. 0 and 1, 4 and 6. 
A loss function with regularization and a gradient descent method is used to achieve optimal training and validation accuracy over 100 epochs.
No machine learning library used other than NumPy for this project. The results of the project can be found in the "Results Project.pdf".
The data folder contains the MNIST handwritten digits file. For more information, refer to the "Task Description.pdf" file.
